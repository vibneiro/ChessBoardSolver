Chess Problem
================
The problem is to find all distinct layouts of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with dimensions MÃ—N 
where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. Assume the colour of the piece does not matter, 
and that there are no pawns among the pieces.

Write a program which takes as input:

  - The dimensions of the board: M, N.
  - The number of pieces of each type (King, Queen, Bishop, Rook and Knight) to try and place on the board.

As output, the program should yield the number of distinct layouts for which all of the pieces can be placed on the board 
without threatening each other.

The solution will need to be able to run on a machine having 4G RAM.
